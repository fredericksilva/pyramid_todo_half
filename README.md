##Half Todo Pyramid Application


This application will show you how to make a todo list. 

Why 'half'? Because after you read all the code, you should be able to finish it.

First, clone it:

    git clone git@github.com:marioidival/pyramid_todo_half.git
 
   
Install dependencies:

    cd pyramid_todo_half
    python setup.py develop
    
    
Run server:

    pserve development.ini --reload
    
_If you alter anything in python code, pserve will reload the server for you_


So, start reading the code:

    todopyramid/__init__.py
    todopyramid/routes.py
    todopyramid/views.py



Look on [Pyramid Documentation](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/) for more details.
